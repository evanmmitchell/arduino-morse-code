/* 
 * This Arduino sketch allows two boards to communicate with each other using Morse Code.
 *
 * After uploading this sketch to two Arduino boards, a user may send a string input to one of the boards via the 
 * Serial Monitor. This board then transmits in Morse Code each character of the input using an infrared emitter. 
 * The other board simultaneously receives this message with an infrared sensor, converting the received Morse Code 
 * back into English and printing it to the Serial Monitor. When the transmission is complete, new string inputs 
 * may continue to be sent to either board to be transmitted and received as described above. 
 * Note: If inputs are sent to both boards at the same time, neither will be received.
 *
 * String input from Serial Monitor (input) --> Morse Code transmitted by IR emitter (output) 
 * Morse Code received by IR sensor (input) --> English characters printed to the Serial Monitor (output)
